# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
#
# For example, the following two linked lists: 
#
# A:          a1 → a2
#                    ↘
#                      c1 → c2 → c3
#                    ↗            
# B:     b1 → b2 → b3
#
# begin to intersect at node c1.
#
# Notes:
#
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. 
# You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
# Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
#
