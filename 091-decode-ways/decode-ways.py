# A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
#
#
# 'A' -> 1
# 'B' -> 2
# ...
# 'Z' -> 26
#
#
# Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "12"
# Output: 2
# Explanation:Â It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "226"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:Â It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
